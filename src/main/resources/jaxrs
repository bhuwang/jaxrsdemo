1. About JAX-RS:
	- Jersey, RestEasy, and Restlet libraries available.
	- All these libraries implement a common interface/api
	- If you implement in Jersey and later take jersey out and put RestEasy in and it will seamlessly work fine.
	- This common API is called JAX-RS.
	- JAX-RS is a bunch of interfaces and annotations only. That is it does not have any functionality.
	- Libraries fit in here and implement the interfaces from JAX-RS. These library adds all the functionality.
	- Which to learn? Pick one and learn and and you can easily switch to others. All libraries are interchangable.
	- We will be learning JAX-RS not Jersey/RestEasy/Restlet
	- Jersery - Reference Implementation for the JAX-RS specification
